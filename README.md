Arduino 7-Segment Tutorial - 4 Digit Display Pin Diagram

DisplayTemperature on 4 Digit 7 Segment LED using LM35 Sensor in Arduino Uno 

Here is a diagram showing the pinout of these displays:



The digit pins D1, D2, D3 and D4 need to be connected to current limiting resistors, since they are the common terminals of the digits. The connections are shown below:
